======

Convert a FCCSW data file to DDG4 format:

`./build/fcc2dd4vis`

Filenames are currently hardcoded, `output.root` for FCCSW (as this is the default name for FCCSW output files) and writes `test.root` for output.

The DDEve viewer can be started with `root -l $DD4hepINSTALL/examples/DDEve/DDEve.C`. In the following dialog, the example xml `DDEve_FCCSW.xml` can be used.
Event Data  can then be loaded from the gui menu, selecting the output `test.root` from the conversion.
